# 🌙 The Garden of Forgotten Feelings  
*A Dream‑Like Emotional Web Experience Grown From Human Feelings*  

---

## 🌸 Overview  
**The Garden of Forgotten Feelings** is an immersive, surreal, dream‑driven web experience where the environment transforms based on the emotions users type into the system. Each emotion becomes a **memory seed**, growing into glowing plants, drifting orbs, or fading fragments. The world remembers, evolves, and whispers back — creating a deeply personal emotional landscape that feels alive, fluid, and softly conscious.

This project was built using **Base44 × AI × creative generative logic**, fully aligned with the **Fluid Interface** hackathon constraint.

## 🌫️ Concept Summary  
When a user enters the garden, they step inside a hazy, atmospheric dreamspace filled with drifting fog particles, pulsing light, gradient airflows, and organic motion. The user types a feeling — *joy, loneliness, anger, calm, nostalgia* — and the entire world transforms in real time.

- Colors shift  
- Particle motion speeds or slows  
- Plants bloom, wilt, or mutate  
- Whisper fragments appear  
- Memory seeds drift through the air  
- Past feelings return as aged organisms  

Every visit is unique. Every emotion leaves a trace.

## 💠 Dream Fragments Implemented  
This project merges all **five DreamWare fragments** to build a living emotional ecosystem:

### 🫧 1. Fluid Interface  
- UI feels alive — drifting, pulsing, breathing  
- Gradients ripple like underwater light  
- Elements react to typing rhythm and cursor motion  
- Nothing is static; everything responds

### 🌱 2. Emotional Memory  
- Each typed feeling becomes a memory seed  
- Stored locally using emotional traces  
- Older feelings grow into full organisms  
- The garden becomes a visual emotional diary  

### 🕰️ 3. Temporal Shifts  
- Time behaves strangely  
- Old feelings fade or drift away  
- New ones bloom with brightness  
- Idle state slows the world as if asleep  
- No visit is identical  

### 🌀 4. Metamorphic Media  
Visuals constantly reshape themselves based on emotional tone:  
- **Sadness** → dark fog, slow drift  
- **Joy** → bright colors, faster particles  
- **Anger** → sharp distortions, pulsing bursts  
- **Nostalgia** → warm lighting, soft blur halos  

This world is always becoming.

### 👁️ 5. Voice of the Machine (Text-Only AI)  
The garden whispers short poetic lines:  
- *“The calm you left yesterday still rests under the moss.”*  
- *“It remembers you.”*  

These micro‑messages create an eerie sense of presence — like the system is quietly alive.

## 🧠 Emotion Analysis Engine  
A lightweight local text‑emotion engine detects cues such as:  
- joy  
- sadness  
- calm  
- anger  
- loneliness  
- nostalgia  

No heavy ML models, no voice, no server calls — all beautifully mysterious and fast.

## 🌿 Memory Growth System  
Each emotional seed becomes a unique organism. Its growth depends on:  
- emotional tone  
- age  
- frequency of interaction  

Types of organisms:  
- glowing vines  
- drifting petals  
- floating orbs  
- tiny memory lanterns  

Over time, the garden becomes a map of the user’s emotional evolution.

## 🌁 Visual & Atmospheric Design  
The experience is intentionally dreamy and cinematic:  
- 🌫️ particle fog  
- 🎨 soft gradient atmospheres  
- 💎 glass-like distortions  
- ✨ light pulses and drift  
- 🎬 slow cinematic transitions  
- 🌬️ wind‑like motion physics  

The user should feel like they’re walking through a quiet dream shaped by emotion.

## 🧩 Technical Architecture  
- **Built with Base44**  
- **LocalStorage** for memory persistence  
- **Dynamic CSS variables**  
- **Particle fog + color transitions**  
- **Emotion → Visual mapping engine**  
- **Whisper text system**  
- **Stateful memory system**  
- **Optimized rendering**
